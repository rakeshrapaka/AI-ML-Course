## 🌐 Day 0 – AI Today: Evolution, Roadmap & Careers

### 📘 What This Covers:
- Current state of AI
- Differences between AI, GenAI, Super AI, and OI
- Evolution roadmap of artificial intelligence
- Key roles and job descriptions in the AI/ML industry

### 🌍 Where We Are in AI Today

- **AI (Artificial Intelligence)**: Machines mimicking human intelligence to perform tasks
- **Machine Learning (ML)**: A subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data
- **Deep Learning (DL)**: A deeper subset of ML using layered neural networks for complex tasks
- **Generative AI (GenAI)**: AI that can generate content like text, images, or code (e.g., ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, DALL·E)
- **Super AI**: A hypothetical future AI that surpasses human intelligence across all areas
- **Omnipotent Intelligence (OI)**: A conceptual future AI that is globally interconnected and all-knowing

> ✅ **We are currently in the era of Narrow AI and early Generative AI.**  
> Tools like GPT-4 can generate content, solve problems, and assist with coding — but they do not yet exhibit true human-level general intelligence.
