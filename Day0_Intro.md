🌐 Day 0 – AI Today: Evolution, Roadmap & Careers |                  |

### 📌 What This Covers:

* Where AI is today
* How AI, GenAI, Super AI, and OI differ
* AI evolution roadmap
* Key roles and job descriptions in the AI/ML industry

### 🌍 Where We Are in AI Today

* **AI (Artificial Intelligence)**: Machines mimicking human intelligence to automate tasks
* **Machine Learning (ML)**: A subset of AI that trains systems using data
* **Deep Learning (DL)**: A more advanced subset of ML using layered neural networks
* **Generative AI (GenAI)**: AI that creates — text, images, code (e.g., ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, DALL·E)
* **Super AI**: Hypothetical future AI smarter than humans across all domains
* **Omnipotent Intelligence (OI)**: Future concept of globally interconnected, all-knowing AI systems

> ✅ We are currently at the **Narrow AI + early GenAI** stage. Models like GPT-4 can write, solve problems, and code — but not think across all domains like a human.
