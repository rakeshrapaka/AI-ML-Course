## 🧠 From Data to Model: The Learning Process**

### 🎯 Objectives:

* Understand how data is used to train models
* Learn about features, labels, training & testing
* See what happens “under the hood” during training

### 🍽️ Analogy: Learning to Make Masala Dosa

Imagine you want to teach someone (or a robot!) to make perfect masala dosa.

#### 1. **Features** = Ingredients and heat levels

> Eg: flour type, batter fermentation time, pan heat, oil amount
> **In ML**: features are the inputs

#### 2. **Label** = What makes a dosa “perfect”

> Golden color? Crispiness? Thickness?
> **In ML**: label is the output we’re predicting

#### 3. **Training** = Trying with different combos of features and checking the result

> "If batter is 12 hrs fermented and pan is medium hot → dosa is perfect"
> This builds a **model**: a recipe that connects inputs to output.

## 🧪 Simple Table Example

| Batter Hours | Pan Temp (°C) | Is Dosa Perfect? (Label) |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------------------ |
| 8            | 180           | No                       |
| 12           | 200           | Yes                      |
| 10           | 190           | Yes                      |
| 6            | 150           | No                       |

The model finds patterns:

* If batter ≥ 10 hours and pan ≥ 190°C → likely perfect!

### 🎓 Key Concepts

| Term             | Meaning                                                     |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Training**     | Teaching the model from known data                          |
| **Testing**      | Checking how well it performs on *unseen* data              |
| **Overfitting**  | Like memorizing recipe *too perfectly*, fails on new batter |
| **Underfitting** | Learns too little, can't even make decent dosa              |

### 🧪 Exercise: Identify the Parts

You’re teaching a robot to predict house price.

| Feature                 | Label |
| ----------------------- | ----- |
| Number of rooms         | ?     |
| Size of house (sq ft)   | ?     |
| Distance to city center | ?     |
| Price                   | ?     |

<details><summary>✅ Solution</summary>

* Features = rooms, size, distance
* Label = price

</details>

### 🧠 Bonus Analogy: Studying for Exams

* **Training Set** = Your practice problems
* **Testing Set** = The actual exam
* **Overfitting** = Memorizing practice answers
* **Good Model** = Understands the concepts and applies them to any exam

## 💡 Practical Activity

Try this mini-lab in a spreadsheet:

1. Create columns: `Study Hours`, `Sleep Hours`, `Score (Label)`
2. Fill with sample data:

   ```
   Study: 2, Sleep: 6 → Score: 60
   Study: 5, Sleep: 7 → Score: 85
   Study: 1, Sleep: 4 → Score: 40
   ```
3. Plot `Study vs Score` – see the trend!
4. Predict what happens if Study = 4, Sleep = 6?

<details><summary>✅ Expected Answer</summary>
Likely Score ≈ 75–80 based on trend
</details>
