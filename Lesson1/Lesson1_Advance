## 🧠 Concept (Beginner-Friendly)
Think of **AI Architecture** like **building a city for thoughts**:
- **Neurons → Houses** (individual processing units)
- **Layers → Neighborhoods** (groups of houses with a purpose)
- **Connections → Roads** (data flow)
- **Model → Whole City** (structured to solve problems efficiently)

Modern AI architectures (CNN, RNN, Transformers) are just **different city layouts** optimized for specific tasks.

## 🔍 Core Idea  
An **AI architecture** defines how data flows through the model:
1. **Input Layer** – Takes in raw data (like eyes capturing images)  
2. **Hidden Layers** – Extract features (like the brain processing patterns)  
3. **Output Layer** – Gives predictions (like saying “This is a cat!”)

## 🛠 Practical Exercise  
**Task:** Build a simple neural network that classifies whether a fruit is an apple or orange using only color and weight.

```python
import numpy as np

# Dataset: [weight (g), color_score] -> 0: Apple, 1: Orange
X = np.array([[150, 0.2], [170, 0.3], [140, 0.1], [180, 0.4]])  
y = np.array([0, 1, 0, 1])  

# Simple perceptron
weights = np.random.rand(2)
bias = np.random.rand(1)

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(inputs):
    return sigmoid(np.dot(inputs, weights) + bias)

for epoch in range(1000):
    for xi, yi in zip(X, y):
        output = predict(xi)
        error = yi - output
        weights += 0.01 * error * xi
        bias += 0.01 * error

# Test
print("Prediction for [160g,0.25]:", predict([160,0.25]))
```

## ✅ Solution Explanation
- We used a **single-layer perceptron** (simplest AI brain).
- The model learns to classify using **gradient updates**.
- Even this toy model mimics how an AI architecture works.

## 💡 Everyday Analogy
Training a neural network is like **teaching a child to recognize fruits**:
- Show examples → child forms patterns  
- Make mistakes → child corrects  
- After practice → child predicts correctly  

---

## 🎯 Your Challenge (Day 1 Exercise)  
1. Modify the above code to add **one more feature** (e.g., fruit sweetness).  
2. Train and see if accuracy improves.  
3. Explain in your own words why adding features helps (or doesn’t).
