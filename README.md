## 🌐 Day 0 – AI Today: Evolution, Roadmap & Careers

### 📌 What This Covers:

* Where AI is today
* How AI, GenAI, Super AI, and OI differ
* AI evolution roadmap
* Key roles and job descriptions in the AI/ML industry

### 🌍 Where We Are in AI Today

* **AI (Artificial Intelligence)**: Machines mimicking human intelligence to automate tasks
* **Machine Learning (ML)**: A subset of AI that trains systems using data
* **Deep Learning (DL)**: A more advanced subset of ML using layered neural networks
* **Generative AI (GenAI)**: AI that creates — text, images, code (e.g., ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, DALL·E)
* **Super AI**: Hypothetical future AI smarter than humans across all domains
* **Omnipotent Intelligence (OI)**: Future concept of globally interconnected, all-knowing AI systems

> ✅ We are currently at the **Narrow AI + early GenAI** stage. Models like GPT-4 can write, solve problems, and code — but not think across all domains like a human.

### 💬 Teaching Tip:

> "Before we dive into algorithms and Python, it’s important to see the big picture. AI isn’t just a technical buzzword — it’s evolving fast. From simple rule-based bots to self-learning agents, AI now powers drones, chatbots, recommendation engines, and more. Understanding this evolution and the roles in this space helps you prepare your learning path intentionally."

## 🗓️ Day 1 – Introduction to AI/ML (with Drone & Robotics Perspective)

### 🎯 Objectives:

* Define AI, ML, and Deep Learning
* Explore the types of machine learning
* Understand basic terms: dataset, model, training, features, labels

### 🗣️ What to Say While Teaching:

"Welcome to Day 1! Let’s begin with what this buzzword 'AI' really means.

AI — or Artificial Intelligence — is simply about making machines *think or act intelligently*, similar to humans. Now, within AI, there's a very active area called Machine Learning — this is where computers learn patterns from data and make decisions without being explicitly programmed.

Then we have Deep Learning — a subset of ML — where we use artificial neural networks to handle more complex tasks like image recognition, which is critical in drone vision systems.

In this course, we’ll start with the fundamentals — not just with textbook theory, but also with real-world drone and robotics use cases. For example, if a drone is flying and needs to identify buildings versus trees, that’s a classification problem. If it needs to predict battery life based on speed, that’s regression. If it learns to fly around obstacles by trial and error, that’s reinforcement learning.

We’ll not only learn the concepts — but understand how they’re **applied to flying machines, robots, and smart systems.**"

| **Supervised**    | Model learns from labeled data                                     | Classify terrain or object in drone images  |
| **Unsupervised**  | Model finds hidden patterns in unlabeled data                      | Group areas based on aerial characteristics |
| **Reinforcement** | Model learns by trial and error using feedback (reward/punishment) | Train a drone to navigate through a maze    |
