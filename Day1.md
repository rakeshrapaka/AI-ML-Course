## 🗓️ Day 1 – Introduction to AI/ML (with Drone & Robotics Perspective)

### 🎯 Objectives:

* Define AI, ML, and Deep Learning
* Explore the types of machine learning
* Understand basic terms: dataset, model, training, features, labels

## 🔍 Types of Learning

| Type              | Description                                                        | Drone/Robotics Example                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Supervised**    | Model learns from labeled data                                     | Classify terrain or object in drone images  |
| **Unsupervised**  | Model finds hidden patterns in unlabeled data                      | Group areas based on aerial characteristics |
| **Reinforcement** | Model learns by trial and error using feedback (reward/punishment) | Train a drone to navigate through a maze    |

## 🛠️ Tools You'll Be Using

* **Python**: Language of AI and robotics scripting
* **Jupyter Notebook**: For hands-on experiments and assignments
* **Git/GitHub**: For version control and sharing projects
* **NumPy, Pandas**: For data manipulation
* **Matplotlib, Seaborn**: For visualization

## 💡 Day 1 Hands-On: Git & GitHub Setup

1. Install Git and VS Code (or use GitHub Codespaces)
2. Create a GitHub account
3. Fork this repository
4. Clone it locally:

## 📌 Homework / Extension

* Reflect: What kind of drone-related or robotics task do you want to solve with AI?
* Write a paragraph on it in your GitHub fork.
* Ask ChatGPT to explain reinforcement learning like you're 5 — and try to reword it in your style.
