## 👣 ** What is AI, ML, and DL?**

### 🍽️ Analogy: The Chef Trio

* **AI** is like a **master chef** that can cook anything (decision-making, vision, speech, etc.).
* **Machine Learning (ML)** is the **sous-chef** who learns recipes from past experiences.
* **Deep Learning (DL)** is a **robotic sous-chef** who has many layers of expertise and can handle raw inputs (like images, sound).

| Concept | Real-world Example                |
| ------- | --------------------------------- |
| AI      | Self-driving car making decisions |
| ML      | Spotify learning your music taste |
| DL      | Face recognition in your phone    |

---

### 🧪 Exercise 1: Classify

Look at the systems below and say which ones are:

* AI
* ML
* DL

| System                  | Your Guess |
| ----------------------- | ---------- |
| Google Translate        |            |
| Netflix Recommendations |            |
| Face Unlock on iPhone   |            |
| Roomba cleaning a room  |            |

<details><summary>✅ Solution</summary>

* Google Translate → **AI + DL**
* Netflix Recommendations → **ML**
* Face Unlock → **DL**
* Roomba → **AI**

</details>

## 👣 **Types of Machine Learning**

### 🎮 Analogy: The Learning Kids

Imagine 3 kids learning to play cricket:

1. **Supervised Learning** 🧑‍🏫

   * Coach says: "This is a no-ball. This is a wide. That’s a good ball."
   * Learns from labeled examples.

2. **Unsupervised Learning** 🧩

   * Kid watches lots of matches and finds patterns: "Oh, fast bowlers bowl differently than spinners!"
   * Learns from unlabeled data.

3. **Reinforcement Learning** 🏆

   * Kid plays, gets feedback: “Nice shot!” or “You’re out!” and adjusts over time.
   * Learns from reward/punishment.

### 🧪 Exercise 2: Match the Scenario

Match each to a learning type:

| Scenario                                           | Learning Type (Supervised / Unsupervised / Reinforcement) |
| -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Teaching a bot to drive using labeled images       |                                                           |
| Grouping similar shopping habits of customers      |                                                           |
| Training a robot to climb stairs via trial & error |                                                           |

<details><summary>✅ Solution</summary>

* Driving with labeled images → **Supervised**
* Grouping shopping habits → **Unsupervised**
* Robot trial & error → **Reinforcement**

</details>

## 👣 **Core ML Algorithms (Simple Intros)**

### 🍎 Analogy: Sorting Fruits

#### 🍏 1. **Decision Tree**

Like playing “20 Questions” to identify a fruit:

* Is it red? Yes → Apple
* Is it soft? Yes → Banana
* Uses yes/no splits to reach conclusions.

#### 🍇 2. **K-Means Clustering**

Imagine sorting a mixed fruit basket into groups by size/shape without knowing names:

* Finds patterns and forms clusters.
* Used in **unsupervised learning**.

#### 🧠 3. **Q-Learning (Reinforcement)**

A monkey gets bananas only after jumping 3 times.

* Learns best moves by trial and error.
* Used in **reinforcement learning**.

### 🧪 Exercise 3: Identify the Algorithm

| Problem Statement                           | Likely Algorithm |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Classifying emails into spam or not         |                  |
| Grouping news articles into topics          |                  |
| Teaching a drone to land smoothly via trial |                  |

<details><summary>✅ Solution</summary>

* Email Classification → **Decision Tree / Supervised**
* Grouping articles → **K-Means / Unsupervised**
* Drone Landing → **Q-Learning / Reinforcement**
